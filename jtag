JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) hardware interface to connect chips to testing hardware
Testing method in standard is known as a boundary scan

TAP (Test Access Port) is on supported chip that is controlled with TMS signal.
Contains IR and DR registers. Will process JTAG instructions
TDI, TDO, TCK, TMS, TRST (optional)

TMS (IO14)
TDI (IO12)
TCK (IO13)
TDO (IO15)
EN/RST (enable/reset) signal will trigger a hard reset
asserting BOOT button will trigger DTR/RTS RS-232 signal to put board in download mode after reset
due to improper FTDI serial driver while holding BOOT button press EN and flash

Flash Layout:
bootloader
partition table
nvs (encrypted storage of passwords, ssid, etc.)
phy_init (rf calibration data)
app
custom storage partition

Filesystems:
  * FAT simple
  * littleFS
    want journalling as file corruption likely: littleFS

wear-leveling enough, i.e. distribute writes/erases across memory blocks
filesystem for when storing many irregular sized things like images, audio, database
if storing known sizes, better to use circular buffer:
 - not optimal wear leveling across many sectors
 - no bad block detection, i.e. periodically check for integrity of sections of memory
 - write verification/ECC (error correction code) (memory more susceptible as more exposed?)
 - no power-loss protection; i.e. copy-on-write will copy value and only if successful point new data to it
